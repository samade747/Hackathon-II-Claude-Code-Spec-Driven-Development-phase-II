# Spec-Kit Plus – Specify Subagents

This directory defines reusable intelligence for Spec-Driven Development
using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Structure

- `subagents/` – Domain-specific spec writers
- `skills/` – Execution workflows (clarify, plan, tasks, implement)

## Usage

Specs are generated by calling subagents through Spec-Kit commands:

- /sp.specify
- /sp.clarify
- /sp.plan
- /sp.tasks
- /sp.implement

These agents must follow project constitutions and specs.
